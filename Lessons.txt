1.The best way to debug if a element isn't getting styled properly is by going to the browser and inspect that
particular element and see if there are any other css styling also that are getting applied on that particular
element, if yes, remove them or rename the element , etc.

2. onChange handlers doesn't work properly when u've registered that particular element in the internal state
of the react hook form, see why? Instead you can use the watch method of react hook form to get the current 
state of an element and u can use setValue to update the state of a element manually.

3. In mongoDB, while defining mongoose schema, using --
  { timestamps: true } // ðŸ‘ˆ Adds createdAt & updatedAt automatically

4. We can also submit a form with a button that's outside the form by linking them, assign a id to the form
element and pass form = "form_id" in the opening tag of button, now they are linked together.
