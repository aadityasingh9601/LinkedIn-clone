1.Refactor followed and following buttons.

2.How to manage and persist state properly for things like posts, polls, etc, as the followed, liked,
voted, etc. states are independent for every single post or poll, so should u send backend request to check
for the state for each and every post or poll instance? Aren't they so many backend requests? Search what is
is a better and optimized way to do so.

3. Scheduled posts.

4. Start streak feature.


Build carousels feature(ability to upload and show multiple images),would do in the future, as normally
carousels are uploaded as a single pdf & then get displayed on the frontend, not like we select one file , then
another, then another, not like this.
