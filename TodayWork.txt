1.Refactor followed and following buttons.

2.How to manage and persist state properly for things like posts, polls, etc, as the followed, liked,
voted, etc. states are independent for every single post or poll, so should u send backend request to check
for the state for each and every post or poll instance? Aren't they so many backend requests? Search what is
is a better and optimized way to do so.

3. Build carousels feature(ability to upload and show multiple images).

4. Research properly how u can provide a preview of images while uploading them, as even to get a preview,they
need to reach the cloudinary store and url is returned from there,only then u can show a preview, but 
what if the user removes that image then and chooses another when ? the older image is already uploaded, so 
it's taking space on the cloud, how do u deal with that? Search about the standard practice and also the option
upload from internet.
Also add a loader, so that it UX is improved and the user can see what percentage of their image is uploaded
or is the image even uploading or not?

5. Better way to fetch different people's profile and open different people chat,currently u r passing and
updating currProfileUserId or currUserId on localStorage, but there must be a better way, how about using
react router dom by creating dynamic routes for this purpose, as provided by react router dom. Explore and
make sure to add the lessons to notes, so that u don't repeat the same mistakes and save time later while coding.
